## Findings

**Orders by Quarter**

The orders were fairly evenly distributed throughout each quarter, with the fourth quarter having a slight decrease in orders. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as winter weather causing people to stay indoors, back-to-school activities taking up people's time and energy, or people taking vacations to escape the winter weather.
It would be useful to compare these figures to previous years to see if there are any trends emerging. For improvements going forward the business could include offering discounts or promotions during the winter months to encourage people to order pizza, providing special deals around back-to-school time to make it more appealing to students and families.

**Orders by Month**

It appears that the business experienced a seasonal surge in orders in November due to factors mentioned above for Q4. September had the lowest amount of orders, likely due to the lack of any seasonal holidays during that month. To capitalise on the seasonal spike in the future, the business should consider running an A/B test with two PPC ads - one that caters to product end-users (children) and one targeted to customers (their parents). 

**Revenue by Month**

The months of January, March, May, July, and November have the highest revenues, with each of these having revenues of 70K or higher. This indicates that these months are the peak months for pizza orders. 
The months of February, April, June, August, October, and December have lower revenues, with each of these having revenues of 65K or lower. This suggests that these months could be targeted for discounts and special offers to encourage more orders.

**Revenue by Quarter**

The first and second quarters (January, February, March, April, May, and June) have the highest revenues, with each of those quarters having revenues of 205.35K and 208.73kK respectively. The third quarter (July, August, and September) has a lower revenue of 205.02K, and the fourth quarter (October, November, December) has an even lower revenue of 199.12K. November has a higher revenue compared to the other months in the fourth quarter, suggesting that it could be an outlier.

**Peak Hours**

The peak hours for ordering pizza were between 12 PM and 1 PM Monday - Friday. The popularity of pizza orders during these hours is likely due to the fact that this is the time when people are most likely to be taking a break from work or school. At this time, people are more likely to be looking for a quick and easy meal, and ordering pizza is a convenient and tasty option. 
As a recommendation, the business should ensure that enough staff are working during these peak hours to handle the flow of orders, promote their pizzas during these peak hours and ensure efficient delivery times for customers who prefer to have their orders delivered.

**Days**

There were 4 days where the daily orders reached over 100 and exceeded the average order average daily order of 59.64. One of these days was 4th July, 2015, which was a public holiday in the United States. It is possible that the increase in orders on this day was due to people celebrating the holiday, which drove up pizza demand. 
Also, Black Friday is a popular shopping holiday that falls on the day after Thanksgiving in the United States. Many pizza chains and online retailers offer special promotions on Black Friday, which could explain why the order values exceeded the average on this day. 

**Popular Pizza**

Further analysis of the data revealed that Classic Deluxe is the most popular pizza on the menu, but Thai Chicken Pizza brings in the most revenue because of its higher price. People tend to opt for the more affordable Classic Deluxe, making it the most ordered pizza.
