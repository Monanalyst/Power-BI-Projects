## Findings

**Country of Survey Participants**

This survey provides an insight into the global data professional landscape, with the United States being the most represented country, followed by the United Kingdom and Canada. This could mean that there is larger population of data professionals in those countries or that the survey was more accessible to those countries. 

It could also mean that data professionals from the United States may have a greater presence in the industry therefore more likely to participate in surveys of this nature. This survey used a convenience sampling method, meaning that the participants were chosen based on their availability and willingness to participate. 

**Survey Participation by Gender**

It appears that there are 468 males and 162 females, which is a ratio of 74%:26%. This could suggest that there is a gender disparity in the professional survey. This may also indicate that there are more males than females working in the field, or that males are more likely than females to take part in the survey. 

**Career Switch into Data**

There is a growing demand for data professionals in the industry, as more people are making the switch from other professions into the data field. Data professionals are in demand because of the increasing reliance on data-driven decision making and more companies are now realising the importance of storing and analysing their data.

**Difficulty to Break into Data**

Majority of the respondents found breaking into data to be neither too difficult nor too easy. However, a significant portion of respondents found it to be either difficult or very difficult. This indicates that breaking into data is not always an easy task and requires some effort.

**Favourite Programming Language**

Based on the responses, it is evident that Python is the most popular programming language among data analysts. 255 data analysts chose Python, which is significantly higher than the number of data analysts who chose R or other languages. Python was also popular among students/looking/none and other groups, with 56 and 54 selecting it.

This indicates that Python is a well-rounded and versatile language that is favoured by many. Data engineers and data scientists also showed a preference for Python, with 29 and 20 selecting it. This highlights Python's popularity among the technical and analytical fields.

**Average Salary by Job Title**

It is clear that data scientists, data engineers and data architects have the highest average salaries. These roles are require advanced skill sets, resulting in higher salaries. On the other hand, data analyst and database developer have lower average salaries.

**Happiness**

People are generally satisfied with their work and life balance, as evidenced by the average response of 5.74 out of 10. However, people are less satisfied with their salary, possibly due to a lack of competitive pay or job satisfaction with their current income. They are also satisfied with their ability to learn new skills and with their management, which could be due to a feeling of support and development opportunities.
